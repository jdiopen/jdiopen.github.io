## What is JDI Open?

We are an open science journal-club & peer-mentoring group at the [UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). Our bi-weekly seminars provide the opportunity for students and staff at the department to learn about open science and discuss ideas to implement open science practices in their research.

### Next session (All: Mondays 1-2 PM in the teaching room)
- **29/10/18 The responsible use of p-values and an introduction to power analysis.** We start the session with the question ‘what is the p-value?’ and explore how type-I and type-II errors influence statistical analysis. We then introduce confidence intervals as well as power analyses and tools to improve your ability to draw statistical inferences.
