## What is JDI Open?

We are an open science journal-club & peer-mentoring group at the [UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). Our bi-weekly seminars provide the opportunity for students and staff at the department to learn about open science and discuss ideas to implement open science practices in their research.

### Upcoming sessions
- 11/3/19 **Doing meta-science**: We will speak about the science of doing science, with a particular emphasis on its role in the open science movement. You will hear about influential studies that help us understand how science is done and how scientific procedures can be improved. We will also share a study on open science practices within the field of terrorism studies. Ultimately, we hope to encourage some of you to consider meta-science research in your field.

### Previous sessions
- 25/2/19 **Responsible use of bibliometrics**. The increasing attention on metrics for measuring and assessing research has led to more attention on the fundamental question of whether or not these metrics actually tell us anything useful. From the h-index to the impact factor, many of the most commonly used bibliometrics are misleading or easily misinterpreted, and over-dependence on them can even encourage bad research practices. This talk outlines the push for “responsible metrics”, the work being done at UCL to support this, and what it might mean for the development of Open Science.

- 28/1/19 **Open Education**. A talk from UCL libraries on Open Education: a UCL initiative that promotes sharing education outputs. [Website](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/open-education/) & [slides](https://open-education-repository.ucl.ac.uk/id/document/1014).      
- 14/1/19 **P-values & power**. We start the session with the question ‘what is the p-value?’ and explore how type-I and type-II errors influence statistical analysis. We then introduce confidence intervals as well as power analyses as tools to improve your ability to draw statistical inferences.
- 10/12/18 **Sharing code, sharing data**. We present tools and strategies for sharing code and data, and discuss how you can address potential limitations to sharing (i.e., identifiable, personal data). [Recording](https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk/Play/16095) and [slides](jdiopen.github.io/codesharing.pdf). 
- 26/11/18 **Open Access Publishing**: Opportunities and Challenges. Invited speakers from UCL Library Open Access Team discuss Plan S and (UCL) opportunities for OA publishing. [Slides](jdiopen.github.io/openaccess.ppt).
- 12/11/18: **Open Science for your career**. We explore the role of open science in hiring and promotion, developments in the job market more broadly, as well as practical ways to highlight your open science practices in your CV. Slides [here.](jdiopen.github.io/openscience_dscs_12112018.pptx)
- 15/10/18 **Introduction to Open Science**. Check out the [slides](jdiopen.github.io/introduction_slides.pptx) and [reading](https://psyarxiv.com/ak6jr).
- 29/10/18 **How-to: preregistrations**. Readings [here](https://osf.io/2dxu5/) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116301925), [slides](jdiopen.github.io/preregistrations.pptx) and [recording](https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk/Player/48885135).
