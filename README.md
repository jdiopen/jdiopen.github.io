## JDI Open

We are an open science journal-club & peer-mentoring group at the [UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). Our bi-weekly seminars provide the opportunity for students and staff at the department to learn about open science and discuss ideas to implement open science practices in their research.
