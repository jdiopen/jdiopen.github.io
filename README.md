## What is JDI Open?

We are an open science journal-club & peer-mentoring group at the [UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute). Our bi-weekly seminars provide the opportunity for students and staff at the department to learn about open science and discuss ideas to implement open science practices in their research.

### Next session (All: Mondays 1-2 PM in the teaching room)
- **29/10/18 How-to: preregistrations.** The goal of this session is to show you how pre-registration of a study and analysis helps to make research reproducible and (important for everyone), if done well, efficiently structures your research process. We will introduce an example of a pre-registration template and walk you through the steps to complete it. Please check out readings for this session [here](https://osf.io/2dxu5/) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116301925).
